# Machine Learning lab1
 First lab at my Maching Learning course at college.

**Tasks to do:**
1.	Open the file lab2_ex1.py and read the code. 
2.	Open and read 3 files 'DB.txt', 'HP_small.txt','Tolkien.txt' 
3.	Divide the text 'Tolkien.txt' into 3 parts. 
4.	For building dictionary concatenate the all files to allFilesStr.  
5.	For text comparison, build the dictionary from array allFilesStr. 
6.	For 5 text parts build the frequency matrix wordFrequency in according to the dictionary.

Independent work:
1.	To decrease the frequency matrix dimension build the new frequency matrix wordFrequency2 in according to the condition (sumArray>20). Present results in in the Word file result.docx.

2.	Analyze the texts similarity using distance matrices dist (built from wordFrequency) and dist2(built from wordFrequency2). Write results of analysis  in result.docx (What is the meaning of distance matrix values? Which distance matrix gives better results?) .

3.	Analyze the texts similarity of the texts 'Eliot.txt'(divide into 2 parts) and 'Tolkien.txt' (4 parts). Write results of analysis  in result.docx.
